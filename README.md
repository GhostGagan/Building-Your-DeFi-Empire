# Building Your DeFi Empire

Welcome to this exciting journey! In this tutorial, you'll embark on the adventure of setting up your very own EVM subnet on Avalanche, laying the groundwork for your DeFi Kingdom clone. We'll guide you through creating and deploying a custom subnet, followed by deploying two essential smart contracts: an ERC20 token contract and a Vault contract. These contracts will serve as the cornerstone for your DeFi Kingdom clone, enabling you to dive into the captivating realm of decentralized finance and begin building your empire. Let's dive in!

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Basic understanding of blockchain technology and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) concepts.
- Familiarity with Solidity programming language.
- Access to the Avalanche documentation for reference.

## Overview of Steps

Here's an overview of the steps you need to take:

1. **Set up your EVM subnet:** Utilize our guide and the Avalanche documentation to create a custom EVM subnet on the Avalanche network.
2. **Define your native currency:** Establish your own native currency, which will serve as the in-game currency for your DeFi Kingdom clone.
3. **Connect to Metamask:** Integrate your EVM Subnet with Metamask by following the steps outlined in our guide.
4. **Deploy basic building blocks:** Utilize Solidity and Remix to deploy fundamental smart contracts for your game, such as contracts for battling, exploring, and trading. These contracts will delineate the game mechanics, including liquidity pools, tokens, and more.

## Important Note

Please note that while understanding how DeFi works and how to generate value for users is crucial, this tutorial primarily focuses on setting up an EVM subnet on Avalanche and deploying foundational smart contracts for building a DeFi Kingdom clone. We'll prioritize these fundamental steps to lay a strong foundation for your DeFi journey.
